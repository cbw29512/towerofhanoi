# TowerOfHanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle.

It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with all the disks stacked on one rod, largest at the bottom, smallest at the top.



The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Here is an animation showing how a player would complete the puzzle with 4 disks.
